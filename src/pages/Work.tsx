        I worked on both the backend and frontend systems within of the CMS of farfetch.com portal. Our team's tasks were quite varied, ranging from advancing the editorial content management platform, managing content publication workflow systems, to conducting platform infrastructure changes and migrations. </p>
        
        <p> The CMS platform was based on Java/Spring Boot technology with a PostgreSQL database. It included workflow systems running Camunda based systems with MongoDB database, as well as content indexing based on Solr and GraphQL queries to retrieve the content. Throughout the process, I was able to make various enhancements to the platform in all areas. In the backend, I primarily focused on GraphQL queries, while on the frontend, I made advancements to the application in Javascript using the proprietary library Sencha. As a team leader my task was also to train new developers about the technology and the infrastructure of the entire project.
